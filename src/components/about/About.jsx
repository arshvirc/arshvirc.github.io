        Hi! My name is Arshvir Chaudhary. I am a software developer from Toronto, Ontario, specializing in back-end, data engineering and cloud development.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I am also a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of Waterloo, enrolled in the Honours Computer Science program with Co-op along with a specialization in AI. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of school and internships, I love to go on runs and play hockey or golf. On any given day, you'll either find me out on a run, watching a Leafs game or playing shinny at a local ice rink or at a golf course/simulator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm actively looking for internships for Summer 2025, Fall 2025 and also Winter 2025 where I can grow both as a person as well as a Software Developer. If you've got an opening and you like what you see, let's connect!
