        For as long as I can remember, I have always had a strong interest in creating and contributing to the invention of something "cool" and "interesting". 
        From building LEGO sets as a child, to coming up start-ups ideas for <a href='https://www.deca.org/'> DECA </a> in high school, I found the act of "building" to be something truly fascinating and fulfilling.

        Now entering my 4th year as an undergraduate Computer Science at the University of Waterloo with four internships under my belt, I have ended up trading in my LEGO blocks with algorithms and data structures and my LEGO figures with AWS and NLP models to build and contribute to the creation of something "cool" and "interesting".

        Below, you will find a history of the various contribution I made during my internships and the projects that I have completed/am still working on.
