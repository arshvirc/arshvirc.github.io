        From as long as I can recall, I always loved building things. Regardless of whether it was a Batman Lego
        Set, a business plan for a start-up in a competition or a web app for school, I found the entire process fun.

        Now as a 3rd year Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with four internships under 
        my belt, the problems that I worked on have evolved to developing automation scripts and proof-of-concepts
        for Surf, microservices for Roadpost Inc and working on NLP at Cardea Health. Likewise, my passion for
        problem-solving has also increased.

        Now entering into my fourth year, I'm looking for an opportunity to apply my experience and skills on some new problems
        and grow as a developer and person as well. So without further adieu, please check out the rest of my website.
