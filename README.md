# Welcome
The project is built using JavaScript with React and Tailwind CSS. It is a single page application that displays my greatest projects and some other information about myself. My github profile contains similar information which could make this entire website pointless. However, this portfolio website's main purpose is to provide myself with an opportunity to showcase the skills I have acquired and learn something new by doing.
