# my-portfolio
As the name suggests, this project is my portfolio website.

## Inspiration
I started this project because I wanted to curate a website that showcases my skills and expertise while interwining my personality and cool snippets that I think is funny and exciting to implement. I would like this project to be a one-stop destination to not only present my experience and portfolio of projects, but also give you a first-hand experience of my ability to create cool features just for the sake of learning and building something I deem cool. 

## Technologies:
The current version of my portfolio project utilizes JavaScript and React.
